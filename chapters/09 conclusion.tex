In this paper, we presented the design of an access control framework based on blockchain smart contracts. In order to perform self-sovereign identity, we presented identity integration that can be used for participating in this ecosystem, as well as controling data access right. We described the system architecture, workflow of each functionality, and interactions among users, organizations, and TSPs.
Ethereum smart contract can distribute data access rights, provide tamper-proof identity, and audit log. The prototype of our proposed system was implemented to validate our design on a private network of multiple Geth nodes. Our proposed system solved the shortcomings of the conventional centralized system and enabled distributed access control functionality. This framework can be applied to scenarios that required data sharing and access control. In this framework, users can authorize/revoke data access right directly without any organizations. Organization allows external data access requests from legitimate TSPs if TSPs obtain the consent of the user.\par
Our experimental evaluation shows that our system can handle more than 10,000 user identity creation in a certain response time and can compatible with general systems.
