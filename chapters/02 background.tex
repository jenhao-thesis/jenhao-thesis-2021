\section{MetaMask}
MetaMask is the most popular crypto wallet for accessing Ethereum distributed application (DApp), this tool can enable web3 API in website so that users can interact with various Etehereum blockchain from Javascript~\cite{web3.js}, e.g., Mainnet, Testnet. It also creates identities by the user themself. The user of Metamask can create and manage their identities; moreover, Metamask provides an interface that user can perform a transaction to the connected blockchain.\par
Because the user securely  manages owned Ethereum account through MetaMask, the user can use their private key to sign a transaction or sign data to prove ownership of an account. Using this crypto wallet, the developers of decentralized applications can use their web3.js library to interact with MetaMask without maintaining Ethereum account of users and they can focus on designing and implementing functionality of smart contracts.\par
Regarding the architecture of Dapp, Figure~\ref{fig:architecture_of_dapp} shows that the web3.js libraries can enable user's browser to interact with blockchain so that users can read and write data from smart contracts, send transactions between accounts.

\section{ECDSA}
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used to create a digital signature of data and verify its authenticity without revealing personal information. ECDSA does not encrypt the data, it makes sure that the data was not tampered with.
