\section{MetaMask}
Metamask is a chrome extension for accessing Ethereum distributed application (DApp), this extension can enable web3 API in website so that users can interact with any Etehereum blockchain from Javascript~\cite{web3.js}, e.g., Mainnet, Testnet. It also creates identities by the user themself. The user of Metamask can create and manage their identities; moreover, Metamask provides an interface that user can perform a transaction to the connected blockchain.\par
Because the user manages owned Ethereum account through Metamask, the user can use their private key to sign a transaction or sign data to prove ownership of an account.\par
