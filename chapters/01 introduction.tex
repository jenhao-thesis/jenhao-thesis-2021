Although social login seems to have a lot of benefits, e.g., security, convenience, and ease of use, there has a concern about those service providers may collect sensitive information about the ~\cite{gafni2014social}.
Besides, those social login services are mainly based on the centralized systems that enforce data permit across different parties. If one third party application sends a retrieval request for the data, it must obtain permission from the centralized party.\par
Blockchain technology brings numerous benefits in a variety of industries, providing more security in trustless environments. The blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that storing records or data in blocks and those blocks are linked through cryptographic proofs so that the attacker can not temper any data. In Ethereum blockchain, it provides smart contract to deploy owned autonomous applications without third party.
