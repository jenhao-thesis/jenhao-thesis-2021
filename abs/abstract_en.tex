\begin{abstract}%

	Open Banking has become a trend in the financial industries for providing innovative and diverse services. The concept of open banking aims to give third-party service providers (TSPs) access to customer's financial data for further analysis uses, thereby helping them to get a better deal and improve the customer experience. Since an open banking ecosystem serves as a platform for various participants and establishes trust through trust third party, there has been increasing attention paid to personal information privacy and identity theft. Previous studies have examined blockchain technology applied to open banking for protecting customer's privacy, but identity verification and integration have been lacking.\par
	The objective of our research was to propose a general framework for blockchain-based identification and account integration. In this framework we proposed, the customers can view their data securely on TSPs and have the capability to authorize particular TSP to access their financial data. To realize these functionalities, we apply Ethereum smart contract to our framework and build a distributed application (DApp). Moreover, we also evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and compare it with a centralized system.
