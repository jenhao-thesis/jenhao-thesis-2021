	Open Banking has become a trend in the financial industries for providing innovative and diverse services. The concept of open banking aims to give third-party service providers (TSPs) access to customer's financial data for further analysis uses, thereby helping them to get a better deal and improve the customer experience.\par
	Since an open banking ecosystem serves as a platform for various participants and establishes trust through trust third party, there has been increasing attention paid to personal information privacy and identity theft. Previous studies have examined blockchain technology applied to open banking for protecting customer's privacy, but identity verification and integration have been lacking.\par
	The objective of our research was to formulate the protocols that blockchain-based identification and account integration. Utilizing the protocols we proposed, the customers view their data securely on TSPs and have the capability to authorize particular TSP to access their financial data. In this paper, the Ethereum blockchain was adopted to realize data sharing schema and access control management. Our experiment results show the scalability and usability of our system prototype.
