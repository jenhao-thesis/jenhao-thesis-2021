\begin{abstract}%

	Open Banking has become a trend in the financial industries for providing innovative and diverse services. The concept of open banking aims to give third-party service providers (TSPs) the right access to customer's financial data for further analysis uses, thereby helping them to get a better deal and improve the customer experience. Since an open banking ecosystem serves as a platform for various participants and establishes trust through trust third party, there has been increasing attention paid to personal data privacy and identity integration. Previous studies have examined blockchain technology applied to open banking for protecting customer's privacy, but identity verification and integration have been lacking.\par
	The objective of our research was to propose a general framework for blockchain-based identification and account integration. In this framework we proposed, the customers can view their latest complete data and have the capability to authorize particular TSP to access their financial data. We apply programmable smart contracts to our framework to realize these functionalities and build a distributed application (DApp) that gives customers more autonomy over their own data. Moreover, we also evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and compare it with a centralized system.
