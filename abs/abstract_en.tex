    Open Banking has become a trend in the financial industries for providing innovative and diverse services. The concept of open banking aims to give providers access to customer's financial data securely, thereby helping customers and third-party service providers (TSP) get a better deal and experience. Since an open banking ecosystem serves as a platform for various participants, identity verification and access control management are high priorities. When the bank reveals application programming interfaces to TSP's, the security issues are identity theft, data tampering. The objective of our research was to formulate the protocol flow that blockchain-based identification and account integration. That makes our customers securely access their data and authorize TSP to access their data. In addition to authorization,  they don't need a centralized server to manage their contract for deciding whether disclose data. We used the Ethereum blockchain to implement the system prototype to realize that data sharing and access control management. Our experiment results show the scalability and usability of our system prototype.\par
